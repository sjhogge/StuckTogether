## What is Stuck Together?
Hello fellow Minecrafters! Thanks for checking out my little mod :) 
I wanted to learn how to create forge mods so I decided to recreate in forge and add extra functionality to Dream's Forcefield mod from [this video](https://youtu.be/JAe0QwYre_M).
This mod is currently available on 1.18.2. If you find any bugs, please reach out to me on discord at `BrooKlynOtter#1942`.

This mod will make it so that if you go too far from other players on the server,
everyone will die. Doesn't that sound fun! You can configure the size of the sphere, who all is encased in the death sphere with you, 
and whether the mod is running through in-game Minecraft commands.

## Available Commands

`/stucktogether start` - starts the mod, the death sphere will be around any teams

`/stucktogether stop` - stops the death sphere

`/stucktogether size [size of death sphere]` - Changes the size of the death sphere. Minimum is 5 blocks, maximum is up to you :)

`/stucktogether teams info` - shows who is on your team

`/stucktogether teams create` - creates a new sphere team, with you as team leader

`/stucktogether teams add [player]` - (Leaders Only) Add a new player to your sphere team

`/stucktogether teams disband` - (Leaders Only) Disbands and deletes your sphere team

`/stucktogether teams kick [player]` - (Leaders Only) Removes specified player from your sphere team

`/stucktogether teams leave` - (Non Leaders Only) Leave your sphere team

## Thank You!!
